## We used Unity and C# programming language to develop this game.

## My role on the project:

### Classic Game: 
I was responsible for implementing player and enemy behaviors, weapon system, inventory and animation.

### Custom Feature:
I implemented the custom boomerang logic, created short animations to describe the context and transitions between rooms, and implemented the ender crystal enemy and the boss dragon.
