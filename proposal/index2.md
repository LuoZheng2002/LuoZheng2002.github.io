# Towards "Backboned" AI: an Essentially Rule-Based AI with Minimum Data Training and Lots of Human Effort

## Introduction
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has traditionally been divided into two major approaches: rule-based systems and probabilistic models. Rule-based systems rely on explicit rules defined by experts, while probabilistic models leverage data to make decisions under uncertainty. This project proposes an AI whose core algorithm is rule-based, but it also utilizes probablistic approaches wherever necessary but at the minimum level. It aims at leveraging human being's intelligence and effort to explicitly give AI instructions and clarifications, instead of letting AI solely learn on training data. With its core algorithm being explicit and explainable, the AI system is granted a "backbone" and can be easily maintained and scale, allowing for solving more detailed and comprehensive tasks compared to AI trained by big data. And by designing a convenient and friendly interactive interface between human and AI, we can allow for the general public to participate in AI training, which greatly reduces the cost and accelerates the development process.

## Motivation
### not fun? 
user psychology, refuses to discuss personalized problems with a blackbox, assume a very detailed question cannot be perfectly answered; build mutual understanding through "stack traces".
### leverage human power
human power involved should contribute more
### maintainability and scalability

### no unified algorithm. Best models are usually the most intuitive ones. (atoms, probablistics) Turing reduction fails

### 
Symbolism: verification; most problems: not solved by single algorithm, but requires intuition, neural net (which may be unified in a more abstract level)

## Expectation
### Trilemma?
Sacrifice flexibility, otherwise either sacrifice controllability or developer friendly.
### No correct answers
knowledge base would be chaotic, no perfect representations, but can be eased by introducing modules and contexts, and limit expectations on flexibility.
